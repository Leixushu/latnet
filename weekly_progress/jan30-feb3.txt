Goals:

- Be able to generate fluid simulations of similar quality as original work in Phy-Net repo
- add 3D simulations

Achieved:

- I was able to generate fluid simulations of similar quality as original work but there are some odd instabilities that I still need to address
- Multi-GPU training
- Mostly got 3d sims working but spend more time cleaning up code and making testing faster and easier

Notes:

- I think there may still be some problems with how the network is generating simulations. I think padding the edges that have pressure, boundary, and velocity conditions with zeros could fix this problem
