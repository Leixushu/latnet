# LatNet

A library for performing Lattice Boltzmann fluid simulations using neural networks. A paper going over the method can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09036). The original source code for the paper can also be found [here](https://github.com/loliverhennigh/Phy-Net). This library represents an extension of the original work and is designed to handle large scale simulations. This currently a working progress with an expected first version around mid February.
